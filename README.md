# React Native  

React Native is a **cross-platform JavaScript framework** that runs on React. It allows developers to build **native mobile applications** using JavaScript and React.  

Developers can test their code using **Snack Player**, an online editor provided by **Expo** for quickly testing and sharing React Native code.  

---

## Basic Components  

React Native provides essential UI components similar to HTML elements in JSX.  

### View  
- A fundamental **container** component.  
- Similar to `<div></div>` in JSX.  
- Used to structure layouts and wrap other components.  

### Text  
- Used for **displaying text** in a React Native app.  
- Works like `<p></p>` in JSX.  

### Image  
- Used to display images in the app.  
- Functions like `<img />` in JSX.  

### ScrollView  
- A **scrollable container** that can hold multiple components and views.  
- Allows both **horizontal and vertical scrolling**.  
- Unlike **FlatList**, ScrollView loads **all content at once**, which can cause **performance issues** for large lists.  
- Supports **zoom-in and zoom-out** gestures.  

### TextInput  
- Acts like `<input />` in JSX.  
- Allows users to enter **text input**.  
- Important props:  
  - **onChangeText**: A function called when the text changes.  
  - **onSubmitEditing**: A function called when the text is submitted.  

---

## FlatList  

- Used for **efficiently rendering large lists**.  
- Loads only the **visible items** instead of rendering everything at once.  
- Key props:  
  - **data**: The array containing the list items.  
  - **renderItem**: A function that formats how each item is displayed.  

---

## SectionList  

- Similar to **FlatList** but supports **grouped sections**.  
- Used for **categorized data** (e.g., contacts list, grouped messages).  
- Includes headers and sub-items for better organization.  

---

## Platform Module  

The **Platform module** provides information about the operating system the app is running on.  

### Example:  
```js
import { Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  height: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 200 : 100,
});
```
- This sets different heights for **iOS** and **Android**.  

---

## Platform-Specific Extensions  

React Native allows developers to create **platform-specific files** using extensions. The correct file is **automatically detected and used** based on the platform the app is running on.

### Example:  

```sh
BigButton.ios.js
BigButton.android.js
```

When importing the component:
```js
import BigButton from './BigButton';
```
- React Native will **automatically** choose `BigButton.ios.js` on iOS and `BigButton.android.js` on Android.  
- This helps keep platform-specific logic separate without extra code in a single file.  

---

## Native-Specific Extensions  

React Native also supports writing **platform-independent code** that can be shared across **mobile, web, and NodeJS**.  

---

# Expo  

**Expo** is a production-grade **React Native framework** that simplifies app development. It provides:  
- Developer tools for a **faster development** experience.  
- A **standard library** of native modules.  
- **File-based routing** for easy navigation.  

## Creating a New Expo App  

Run the following command to create a new Expo project:  
```sh
npx create-expo-app@latest
```
Move into the project directory and start the app:  
```sh
npx expo start
```
- You can use an **Android/iOS emulator** to preview the app (**emulator setup required**).  

---

## Expo File Structure  

A typical **Expo project** follows this structure:  

```
- app
- assets
- components
- constants
- hooks
- scripts
- app.json
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
```

### app  
- Defines the **main file structure** of the application.  

### assets  
- Stores **static assets** such as images, icons, and fonts.  

### components  
- Contains **reusable UI components** (e.g., buttons, cards, and modals).  

### constants  
- Stores **global values** like theme colors and API URLs.  

### hooks  
- Contains **custom hooks** that share logic between components.  

### scripts  
- Stores **automation scripts** to manage the project efficiently.  

### Example: Reset the project  
```sh
npm run reset-project
```
- Moves the app into a **backup folder** (`app-example`) and creates a **new app directory**.
